To sort your photos into folders by date


Sometimes I get a bunch of photos from my friends camera through whatsapp or bluetooth. 

The problem is that, it'll all be scattered after a few days of receiving photos.

So I made a simple script, to sort all the photos based on the date they were received into folders.

The folder name will be the date on which you received the photo. Rename it appropriately.

Eg.
On July 3,2015 I received a bunch of graduation photos

On July 5, 2015 I received a bunch of photos from a theme park

On July 8, 2015 I received a bunch of photos from eating out.

In between these days, I received a bunch of crap.

So what you do, is copy all these photos into a new folder.

Run the python program, and voila!

You'll have the photos sort according to date, and hence having all the photos of one category into a single separate folder.
